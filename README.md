# Advent of Code 2025

## Overview
This repo is a collection of my solutions to the Advent of Code 2025 puzzles. This year I have decided to attempt the #
solutions in `Go` instead of python to help validate and continue testing my `Go` skills. Each day's puzzle is in its 
own folder. There is a main.go file in the root that can run puzzles individually.

## Testing
Where possible I will try to write tests for each puzzle. This allows for a semi-form of Test Driven Development.
